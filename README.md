# lpoo-2021-g11 - Escape the Mansion

"Escape the Mansion" is a puzzle-strategy game where the player is trapped in a haunted mansion.
In order to win, the player must escape it while running from ghosts and collecting various items to unlock
all the levels (represented by floors).

Our idea was inspired by *Escape Room* games and also the game *Luigi's Mansion*.
